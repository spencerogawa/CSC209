CSC209H1 Software Tools and Systems Programming (Winter 2015)

Several C codes (assignments/projects) from CSC209H1 course at University of Toronto.

##### shell.c

> A great assignment to learn how `pipe()` and `dup2()` work in the Linux environment. You can make your own shell! (Disclaimer: some commands do not work with this mini-shell.)
